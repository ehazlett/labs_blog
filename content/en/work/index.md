### Come work with us

Do meaningful work. Take ownership. Never stop learning.

### Who we are

We’re curiosity-driven readers, writers, designers, developers, and strategists from over 40 different countries.

We've come together to share the power of big ideas, build a meaningful product, and foster a supportive culture of self-empowerment, creativity, and trust.

### What we do

We create bitesize content products so people can easily fit reading and learning into their lives.

We also love to travel, meditate, play board games, take part in quizzes (and design our own!), play with dogs, DJ, brew beer, celebrate holidays, surprise each other on special occasions, hike, and dance.

### Why we do it

We’re on a mission to inspire people to keep learning. In doing so, we lead by example.

By making learning central to what we do, we push boundaries of the unknown, using every chance we get to develop ourselves by improving our product and the world around us.
