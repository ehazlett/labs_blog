Kentik Labs is a community hub developed by the team at Kentik.com.

At our core, we are the data-dreaming network nerds who built an observability platform that makes much of the internet go.

But what fun is the internet without the awesome applications and services that developers build? And what fun is any of that if there’s a problem somewhere along the way?

Many developers and SREs turn to full-stack observability to find and fix problems before performance and user experiences suffer. But what if it’s a network problem?

We believe true full-stack observability doesn’t exist without network observability. That’s why we open source our tools. Let’s work together, diagnose any issue across any infrastructure (the network included!), and keep the internet fun.

Got a question? Reach out.

Want to join us? We’re hiring.
